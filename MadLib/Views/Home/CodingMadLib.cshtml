    <h2>Programming can be a @Model.Adjective1 experience, especially when working with @Model.ProgrammingLanguage Sometimes the code can be so @Model.Adjective2 that it feels like you're trying to do @Model.ProgrammingConcept with a spoon. But with enough practice, you can write code that runs @Model.Adverb and efficiently. Just remember to always test your code thoroughly, or you might end up with  @Model.Number @Model.PluralNoun in your program. Even the most @Model.Adjective3 programs can be broken down into smaller, more manageable @Model.Noun.
